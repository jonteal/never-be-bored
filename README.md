# Never Be Bored!

<a name="description"></a>

## Description
Do you get bored often? Hopefully not, but if you do, this VERY simple app has you covered! All you need to do is hit the 'Get Activity' button, and this API will deliver an endless stream of activities for you to do. One key feature and is that it has many types of activities for you to try, and based on the type of activity, the background image will change to match that category. That's about it, so go have fun relaxing, being productive, staying busy, or whatever else you randomly get when you hit the button!
